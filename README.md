Instructions on how to run the program:

## Requirements:
- Git (for cloning or download zip from GitHub)
- Node Js v22.16.0 that uses npm 10.9.2 (Added to PATH if not already) 
- Link for Node Js download: https://nodejs.org/en/download

## Instructions to run:

1. Navigate inside to the /server folder via your cmd or your vscode terminal
and run:
'npm i express' (This installs the node_modules for the server)

2. Navigate inside the /client folder via your cmd and run:
'npm install' (This install the node_modules dependencies for the client)

3. Navigate to /server and run:
'npm run start'

4. Open another terminal while the server is running on the previous one, and navigate to /client and run:
'npm start'

After the last command you should see your browser automatically opening the project so that you can test it.

To stop the running just run 'Ctrl + C' and 'Yes' on both the /server and /client.
